;###EXERCISE 1###
;Check that the following formula is a tautology:
; (p => q and r) => (p => q) and (p => r)

;we start declaring our propositions

(declare-const p Bool)
(declare-const q Bool)
(declare-const r Bool)

;to check the tautology we check the unsatisfiability
;of the negation of the assertion

(assert (not (=> (=> p (and q r)) (and (=> p q)) (=> p r))))

(check-sat)
