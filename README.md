# Z3 solver exercises
This repositary aims to be a small collection of excercises in computational logic using z3 solver.
The documentation for z3 can be easily find in its github directory.
Files will be .txt files written in SMT-LIB2 standard, but I will probably upload some Python script in the future.
Hence you need to check them by running z3 through your Terminal or using any other method you like :)
